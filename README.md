Paper data and code
This is the code for the Paper: A graph neural network with topic relation heterogeneous multi-level cross-item information for session-based recommendation. We have implemented our methods in Pytorch.

Here are two datasets we used in our paper. After downloaded the datasets, you can put them in the folder datasets/:

YOOCHOOSE: http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challenge.html

DIGINETICA: http://cikm2016.cs.iupui.edu/cikm-cup or https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/11161

There is a small dataset sample included in the folder datasets/, which can be used to test the correctness of the code.
